Hi, I'm Damar Wicaksono, currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Chair of Risk Safety, and Uncertainty Quantification](http://www.rsuq.ethz.ch/) of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich (ETHZ). At my current role, I'm a member of [UQLab](https://www.uqlab.com) development team and I helped co-established and currently manage [UQWorld](https://uqworld.org), an online community platform for applied uncertainty quantification (UQ).

I used to work with computer simulations, mostly the ones used in nuclear engineering applications. Later on, I became more focus on the statistical methods to analyze the uncertainty of similar simulations: metamodeling, sensitivity analysis, calibration, and uncertainty propagation. One of my previous work even made into [a sort of book](https://github.com/damar-wicaksono/wd41-thesis) with [a piece of paper](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/253113?ln=en) that went along with it. I program in R, Python, and MATLAB to get things done.

On my spare time on the web, I enjoy visiting random technical documentation sites, thinking about their voice and tone, savoring their visual designs, and trying to understand the software infrastructure behind each of them.

In summer, I go hiking in the Swiss mountains.

## About this website

I wrote about why I even have this site [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-07-10-what-is-this-all-about %}).

This website is made powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using the [minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) with additional hack-and-paste modifications from around the web. Learning a thing or two about web devs. is an ongoing process for me.
