So, what is this all about? I've been meaning to create my own web site for some time[^domain]. Yet, it is not as if I have lots, if any for that matter, of things to say. At the same time, I've been writing and collecting notes, long and short, along the way[^work]. Some of them are actually worthy for my own reference that I can go back and look conveniently. Having them published online, I think, fits that convenience bill.

So, this is about:

- **Math notes**, in particular my own personal notes, that I need to refer back to quickly. I'm not particularly good at math and writing them actually helps me understand a concept better.
- **Projects** I did or have been doing. This site is my chosen platform to highlight such projects or perhaps simply to comment on it; a recap on what I've been doing (as in holding myself accountable with the time I spent breathing).
- My **Resume** which might be useful if I'm, well, on a fishing expedition[^now].
- A thing or two about **Web dev.** I learn along the way. It starts here, expanding and modifying this live site.

As a starter project, I'll begin with converting my dissertation (originally written in LaTeX) as an online publication. I still refer to it from time to time and I've been keeping this in mind for some time; part of the dissertation is actually already converted using sphinx-doc to an HTML format and hosted on [readthedocs](https://wd41-thesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). But I learned recently about the intrigeuing [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) project. As I've been letting my `R` skill to get a bit rusty in my current job[^MATLAB], I'd rather restart this project there, one chapter (okay, maybe just one section) at a time.

[^domain]: registering and having my own domain name was more about my job of setting up a Discourse forum prototype and less about having this site.
[^work]: come to think about it, my job, old and new, is actually mostly involved writing (or is it _just_ [typing](https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/)?), and a bit of coding here and there. It's a lifelong process, isn't it?
[^now]: as in now.
[^MATLAB]: MATLAB rocks(?)
