# Hi
	
This is my personal website, where I can put and find my notes I've collected along the way for quick reference. If you somehow find any of them useful, then I'll be quite happy. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Chair of Risk Safety, and Uncertainty Quantification of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich (ETHZ).
