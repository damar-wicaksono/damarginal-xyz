# Hi
	
This is my personal website, where I can put and find my notes I've collected along the way for quick reference. It's rather insignificant. If you somehow find any of them useful, then it'll be, well, marginally insignificant. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the Chair of Risk Safety, and Uncertainty Quantification of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich (ETHZ).
