As they say, in the spirit of sounding _academese_,
"a dissertation submitted as a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy in Physics."
The sentence did not, however, appear anywhere in my dissertation.
But after it was defended and accepted, it indeed served its purpose.

I've wrote my dissertation pretty much the better part of the better part of 2017 (it's from spring to end fall).
I originally thought, naively, that I could reuse results from my papers. 
But the truth was I had to re-ran and re-analyzed most of them to have a coherent thesis.
Worse, a main chapter was still completely missing at the time.

Figures and illustration also had to be prepared individually.
Being rather particular, I created all the illustrations myself.
I wanted things to be monochromatic because then I didn't have to think about choosing a color scheme.
In the end, I was pretty happy with the results.

It was, to say the least, a rather gruelling process[^once].

I did receive a lot of supports during this period, professionally and personally.
My advisors put tons of extra time reviewing and iterating with me the document.
My friends kept my limited social life, well, alive.
My girlfried (at the time, now she's my wife) really put up with my ever worsening antics[^antics].

I've sent the thesis to the doctoral school administration of EPFL 
few of days before Christmas holidays began, the day before the deadline, and the day I'm flying home to Indonesia.
I had the impeccable Swiss Post [^SwissPost] to thank for this.
Speaking of how things are perfectly aligned every once in a while.

I couldn't be happier with the jury composition:
Dr. Jean Baccou of IRSN, France; Dr. Winfried Zwermann of GRS, Germany;
and Prof. Sudret of ETH Zurich.
The first two are experts in uncertainty quantification applied in nuclear engineering;
one (Dr. Baccou) in thermal-hydraulics and another (Dr. Zwermann) in neutronics.
Prof. Sudret, on the other hand, is an expert in UQ methods (quite [a prominent one](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=lkIklpIAAAAJ), too I might say)
with extensive experience in industry.
I think this composition befitted the central topics of the dissertation:
UQ in nuclear engineering applications.
These people, mind you, went through the dissertation during a holiday season.
I was proud and grateful to have them in my defense committee.

So their decision to accept my thesis without any reservation really did make my day.
With that a chapter was closed[^Minke].

[^once]: Once in a lifetime is enough.
[^antics]: Thesis writing brings the worse out of people; it's true.
[^SwissPost]: Though recently, for the first time after years living in Switzerland, they delivered a half torn letter with apology that it got stuck in a machine. Oh well...
[^Minke]: But an expression I like better is from my native language: "tutup buku" (literally _close a book_), which I first discovered from Pramoedya Ananta Toer's _Anak Semua Bangsa_.
